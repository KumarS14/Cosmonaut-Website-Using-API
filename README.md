Website Link : https://kumars14.github.io/Cosmonaut-Website-Using-API
A responsive React single-page application (SPA) built with Vite, showcasing the human stories behind space exploration. This app provides a clean, fast, and visually-driven gallery of astronaut profiles and future space missions.

This project was built to solve the problem of spaceflight content being scattered across dense archives and technical websites. It targets visual learners by aggregating images, concise biographies, and mission videos into one engaging experience.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** Fully adaptive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using fluid typography and CSS grids.
* **Client-Side Routing:** A seamless multi-page experience with no reloads, powered by React Router.
* **Astronaut Gallery:** A grid of astronaut profiles that open an interactive modal with a detailed biography on click.
* **Future Expeditions:** A showcase of upcoming missions (Artemis III, Lunar Gateway, Europa Clipper) with embedded videos and descriptions.
* **About Page:** A summary of the project's mission and a functional (placeholder) contact form.

## Tech Stack

* **Vite:** Next-generation front-end tooling for fast development and optimized builds.
* **React 19:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **React Router v7:** Declarative routing for React applications.
* **ESLint:** For code linting and maintaining code quality.
